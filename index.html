                    Art is a creative activity that expresses imaginative or technical skill. It produces a product, an object. 
                    Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, performing artifacts, and expressing the author's imaginative mind. 
                    The product of art is called a work of art, for others to experience.
                    This will in turn lower the feelings of depression and increase the feeling of confidence.
                    Art, in its broadest sense, is a form of communication. 
                    It means whatever the artist intends it to mean, and this meaning is shaped by the materials, techniques, and forms it makes use of, as well as the ideas and feelings it creates in its viewers . 
                    Art is an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.
                    Moreover, it makes us feel better about ourselves.<br>
